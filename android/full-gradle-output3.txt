FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Could not determine the dependencies of task ':app:packageDebug'.
> Could not create task ':app:compileDebugJavaWithJavac'.
   > Using '--release' option for JavaCompile is not supported because it prevents the Android Gradle plugin
     from setting up the bootclasspath for compiling Java source files against Android APIs
     (see https://issuetracker.google.com/278800528).
     Please use Java toolchain or set 'sourceCompatibility' and 'targetCompatibility' options instead.
     (see https://developer.android.com/build/jdks#source-compat).

* Try:
> Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
> Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
> Run with --scan to get full insights.
> Get more help at https://help.gradle.org.
